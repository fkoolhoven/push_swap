# About the Project

A project made in accordance with the push_swap project which is part of the Codam Core Curriculum. It is a very simple and a highly straightforward algorithm project: a list of integers must be sorted. You have at your disposal a set of integer values, 2 stacks, and a set of instructions
to manipulate both stacks. Your goal? Write a program in C called push_swap which calculates and displays
on the standard output the smallest program, made of push_swap language instructions, that sorts the integers received as arguments.
